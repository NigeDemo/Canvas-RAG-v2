# Next Session - Start Here

**Date**: October 14, 2025  
**Status**: Phase 1 verification complete ‚úÖ  
**Git Status**: ÔøΩ Safe to push after normal review

## ‚úÖ Recap: What Changed Since October 3

- Hybrid image retrieval pipeline now returns live Canvas preview links (verified Oct 14).
- Streamlit smoke test confirms "What is covered in Session 5?" produces module-aware responses with real content.
- Backend harness covers general-topic queries (steel frames, deliverables, section listings) with intent detection working as designed.

See: `SESSION_SUMMARY_VISION_FIX.md` (historical) and `NEXT_SESSION_TASKS.md` (current priorities) for deeper context.

## üéØ Top Priorities Moving Forward

### Priority A: Streamlit UX Polish
- [ ] Backfill missing `alt_text` labels for Canvas images so link text is readable.
- [ ] Confirm section queries render cleanly in the UI (try "What sections are on Construction Drawing Package page?").

### Priority B: Phase 3 Optimization Kick-off
- [ ] Begin response-time profiling and cache tuning (see `NEXT_SESSION_TASKS.md`).
- [ ] Revisit embedding model strategy and quota plan.

### Priority C: Regression Safety Net
- [ ] Fold the Oct 14 validation script into an automated smoke test.
- [ ] Keep `COMPREHENSIVE_TESTING_PLAN.md` as the regression checklist; all Phase 1 items are now baseline expectations.

> ‚úÖ Phase 1 image retrieval and module query smoke tests passed on Oct 14. Use the lists above as regression checks rather than blockers.

## üéØ PRIORITY 2: Module Query UI Testing

### Quick Start

1. **Start the app:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run src/ui/vision_chat_app.py
   ```

2. **Test this query first:**
   ```
   What is covered in Session 5?
   ```

3. **What you should see:**
   - ‚úÖ Real content from Session 5 materials
   - ‚úÖ Explanation of Canvas module structure
   - ‚úÖ NO generic phrases like "likely covers" or "probably discusses"
   - ‚úÖ Mentions of actual files and modules

---

## What Was Fixed (Module Queries)

**Problem**: Asking "What is covered in Session 5?" gave generic, hallucinated responses

**Root Cause**: vision_chat_app.py wasn't using our module-aware templates

**Solution**: Modified `src/vision/vision_rag_integration.py` to use proper templates

**Result**: Module queries now work perfectly! ‚úÖ

---

## Completed Items (for the record)

- ‚úÖ Image references indexed + metadata confirmed via `check_database.py`.
- ‚úÖ Streamlit UI now renders Canvas preview links for image queries.
- ‚úÖ Module template routing validated in both backend harness and UI.
- ‚úÖ Hybrid retriever wired to pass original query for intent detection.

---

## If Tests Pass ‚úÖ

Great! Keep momentum going:

1. **Optional**: Investigate missing 5th section heading
2. **Optional**: Merge or clean up unused `chat_app.py`
3. **Ready**: Dive into Phase 3 (performance optimization)

---

## If Tests Fail ‚ùå

Run diagnostics:

```bash
python test_vision_rag_session5.py
```

This will show exactly where the problem is:
- Module query detection
- Retrieval
- Context extraction
- Template selection
- Response generation

## Documents to Review

1. **SESSION_SUMMARY_VISION_FIX.md** - Full session summary
2. **VISION_CHAT_MODULE_FIX_COMPLETE.md** - Technical details
3. **STREAMLIT_APPS_COMPARISON.md** - Architecture comparison

Tip: For a structured index of current, authoritative docs (and which files are historical), see `docs/README.md`.

**Module Detection**: ‚úÖ Working  
**Query Enhancement**: ‚úÖ Working  
**Template Selection**: ‚úÖ Fixed  
**Vision App**: ‚úÖ Ready to test  

**Next**: Test in Streamlit UI! üöÄ
