# Next Session Task List - Phase 3 Optimization & Performance

## üéØ Session Goals
Focus on performance optimization, embedding model resolution, and finalizing production deployment with completed Phase 2++ query enhancement system.

## üìã Priority Tasks

### 1. Query Enhancement Production Validation
```bash
# Verify query enhancement is working in production
streamlit run src/ui/vision_chat_app.py

# Test enhanced queries:
# - "floor plan" ‚Üí should expand to layout, site plan, building plan
# - "how to create elevations" ‚Üí should enhance with method, technique, procedure
# - "what sections" ‚Üí should enhance with headings, structure, topics
# - "analyze drawing" ‚Üí should enhance with diagram, visual, graphic

# Check debug logs for enhancement traces
Get-Content logs/canvas_rag.log | Select-Object -Last 50
```

### 2. BM25 Sparse Retrieval Integration
**Current Issue**: BM25 index not initializing properly for hybrid search

```bash
# Debug BM25 initialization
python debug_db.py  # Check current index state

# Test BM25 building
python build_sparse_index.py

# Verify hybrid search functionality
python test_retrieval_comparison.py
```

### 3. Performance Optimization
**Focus Areas**:
- Query response time optimization
- Vision AI caching improvements
- Memory usage monitoring
- API rate limiting efficiency

**Tasks**:
- Profile query processing pipeline
- Optimize embedding model usage
- Implement advanced caching strategies
- Monitor system performance metrics

### 4. Embedding Model Resolution
**Current Challenge**: OpenAI quota limits affecting development

**Options to Evaluate**:
- Optimize OpenAI usage with better caching
- Evaluate alternative embedding models (Hugging Face, local models)
- Implement embedding model fallback strategies
- Cost optimization for production deployment

### 5. Missing Section Heading Investigation
**Legacy Issue**: Still only detecting 4/5 section headings

```bash
# Investigate missing section heading
python check_section_headings.py

# Debug section detection patterns
python scripts/run_pipeline.py --course-id 45166 --page-url construction-drawing-package-2 --debug
```

### 6. Production Deployment Preparation
**Goals**:
- Finalize configuration management
- Optimize resource usage
- Prepare deployment documentation
- Test system reliability and error handling

## üîç Current System Status

### ‚úÖ Completed (Phase 2++)
- **Query Enhancement**: Intelligent architectural synonym expansion working
- **Section-Aware Architecture**: Detection and retrieval fully functional
- **Vision AI Integration**: GPT-4 Vision analysis for architectural drawings
- **Production Testing**: Query enhancement validated in Streamlit interface
- **Documentation**: All project files updated with current capabilities

### üîÑ In Progress (Phase 3)
- **BM25 Integration**: Sparse retrieval needs proper initialization
- **Performance Optimization**: Response time and caching improvements
- **Embedding Model Strategy**: Resolve OpenAI quota limitations

## üìä Success Criteria

### Query Enhancement Validation
- ‚úÖ Architectural synonym expansion working in production
- ‚úÖ Debug logs showing proper query enhancement traces
- ‚úÖ All query types (visual, section, question) properly enhanced
- ‚úÖ Configuration flags (enable/disable, max terms, debug) functional

### Performance Optimization
- ‚úÖ BM25 sparse retrieval properly initialized and functional
- ‚úÖ Hybrid search fusion working with optimal weights
- ‚úÖ Query response times under 3 seconds for typical queries
- ‚úÖ Vision AI caching reducing redundant API calls

### Production Readiness
- ‚úÖ System stable and reliable for extended use
- ‚úÖ Error handling robust across all components
- ‚úÖ Resource usage optimized for deployment
- ‚úÖ Documentation complete and up-to-date

## üö´ Known Issues to Address

1. **BM25 Initialization**: Sparse retrieval index not building properly
2. **Performance Optimization**: Query response times could be improved
3. **Missing 5th Section**: Legacy issue with section detection (lower priority)
4. **Embedding Model Strategy**: Need resolution for OpenAI quota limitations

## üìù Next Session Notes

- **Priority 1**: BM25 sparse retrieval integration and testing
- **Priority 2**: Performance optimization and response time improvements
- **Priority 3**: Embedding model strategy and quota management
- **Priority 4**: Production deployment preparation and reliability testing

**Current State**: Phase 2++ complete with query enhancement fully implemented and documented. System is production-ready for text and vision queries with intelligent enhancement. Focus now shifts to Phase 3 performance optimization.

---

**Goal**: Complete Phase 3 performance optimization with functional hybrid search, optimized response times, and resolved embedding model strategy for full production deployment.
