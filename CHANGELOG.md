# Changelog

All notable changes to Canvas RAG v2 will be documented in this file.

## [2.0.0] - 2025-07-17 - Phase 2 Complete âœ…

### Added
- **Vision AI Integration**: GPT-4 Vision and Claude Vision API support
- **Architectural Drawing Analysis**: Detailed analysis of electrical plans, elevations, sections
- **OCR Capabilities**: Text extraction from architectural drawings
- **Vision-Enhanced Chat Interface**: New Streamlit app with vision capabilities
- **Intelligent Caching**: Vision analysis result caching to minimize API costs
- **Multiple Analysis Types**: Comprehensive, spatial, technical, OCR analysis options
- **Enhanced Image Processing**: Specialized handling for architectural drawings

### Changed
- **Primary Interface**: Moved to `src/ui/vision_chat_app.py` for vision-enhanced experience
- **Query Processing**: Added vision AI integration for image-related queries
- **Response Generation**: Enhanced with actual visual analysis instead of filename matching
- **Project Structure**: Organized into professional directories (debug/, tests/, setup/)

### Fixed
- **Image Reference Extraction**: Fixed dictionary format handling from HybridSearchEngine
- **Vision AI Pipeline**: Resolved generic response issue with electrical plan queries
- **Project Organization**: Cleaned up development artifacts for GitHub deployment

### Technical Notes
- **Phase 2 Complete**: Vision AI integration fully functional
- **Vision Providers**: GPT-4 Vision (primary), Claude Vision (fallback)
- **Analysis Capabilities**: 4000+ character detailed responses for architectural drawings
- **Caching System**: Efficient result caching to avoid redundant API calls

## [1.0.0] - 2025-07-03 - Phase 1 Complete

### Added
- LLM-powered response generation using GPT-4
- Enhanced image query detection with keyword and phrase matching
- Improved system prompts for architectural drawing assistance
- Debug interface in Streamlit chat app
- Clickable markdown links for image references
- Enhanced image retrieval prioritization for visual queries

### Changed
- Switched from basic search result concatenation to intelligent LLM synthesis
- Improved user prompts to explicitly instruct LLM about image capabilities
- Enhanced error handling and logging throughout the chat application
- Updated query detection to handle more natural language patterns

### Fixed
- Image references now properly included in LLM context
