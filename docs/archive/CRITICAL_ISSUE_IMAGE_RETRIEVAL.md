# 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUE - READ THIS FIRST

**Date**: October 3, 2025  
**Status**: Module queries fixed ✅ BUT image retrieval broken 🔴  
**Git Status**: 🔴 **DO NOT PUSH TO GITHUB** - Wait until issues resolved

## What's Broken: Image Retrieval

**User Query**: "List all images from this canvas topic"

**Current Response**: 
- ❌ "It appears that there are no images available..."
- ❌ Falls back to generic textbook architectural guidance
- ❌ Does NOT show actual images from Canvas

**What Should Happen**:
- ✅ List all images indexed from Canvas topic
- ✅ Show image descriptions and URLs
- ✅ Allow students to click and view images
- ✅ Display architectural drawings (floor plans, elevations, sections)

---

## Why This Is Critical

**This is a student-facing tool for an ARCHITECTURE course.**

Students need to:
- 📐 View architectural drawings
- 📋 Access floor plans, elevations, sections, details
- 🖼️ Study visual examples from course materials
- 📸 Interact with actual Canvas images

**Current behavior = UNACCEPTABLE** for the intended use case.

---

## What Works ✅

- ✅ Module queries ("What is covered in Session 5?")
- ✅ Text content retrieval from PDFs/PowerPoints
- ✅ Query enhancement and detection
- ✅ Template selection for module queries
- ✅ Database has 1,068 documents indexed

## Next Session Priority

### 1. Investigate Image Retrieval (1 hour)

**Step 1**: Check database
```bash
python check_database.py
```
Look for: `image_reference` content type

**Step 2**: Test retrieval
```bash
python  # Create test_image_retrieval.py
```

**Step 3**: Test in UI
```bash
streamlit run src/ui/vision_chat_app.py
```
Query: "List all images from Session 5"

**Step 4**: Fix the issue

**Step 5**: Retest and verify

## Full Testing Plan

See: **COMPREHENSIVE_TESTING_PLAN.md**
- Image retrieval testing (CRITICAL)
- Module query testing
- PDF/PowerPoint content testing  
- Section query testing
- Vision AI testing
- Edge case testing

**Estimated Time**: 2 hours for full test suite

## Remember

This RAG system is for **STUDENTS** to interact with **ACTUAL CANVAS CONTENT**.

Generic textbook responses are NOT acceptable.  
Students need REAL images, REAL files, REAL course materials.

**Fix image retrieval before anything else!** 🔴

**Status**: 🔴 Critical issue requiring immediate attention  
**Priority**: Image retrieval must work  
**Timeline**: ~1 hour to investigate and fix
